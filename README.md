# Portfolio Website - *my personal website*
**A personal Portfolio website, all about me and my coding projects**

## General info

This is my own personal Portfolio website. My website currently features two different pages. It comes with a *Home* page, as well as a *Work* page for additional portfolio projects.  There is a navigation menu at the top of the *Home* page to link to various sections: the *Portfolio*, *About*, and *Contact* sections.  Also, the *"MORE-->"* link on this page takes the user to my *Work* page. There are external links located in the *Contact* section, which allows the user to access my social media and *Github* pages.  There is also a link to my email address, as well as other contact information.

My website has been developed to be responsive to various devices, with a **mobile-first design**.  The navigation menu also collapses to be mobile-friendly, with a "hamburger" icon to access and reopen it.

The purpose of this project was to build a personal website to showcase all my coding projects as a web developer, and to tell more about myself!  I have created and coded this website from its beginning.  I have strived to keep my code neat, organized, and easy to read.  This site has given me plenty of opportunity to practice with a variety of HTML5 and CSS syntax, as well as some JavaScript.  I have focused on keeping it simple and easy to use.  I've learned skills in page layouts as well.  For responsiveness, I even went back and restructured the entire site as mobile-first.

This website will continue to be adjusted and enhanced regularly, and has been a great learning experience.  While it contains many projects, the website in itself has proven to be great project, with many coding skills being used along the way.  I regularly have the opportunity to get the content uploaded and live on the internet, and to track this and the other projects on *Git and Github*.  I also enjoy seeing my progress, as I pick up many new coding skills in my journey. It's exciting to learn more every day!
